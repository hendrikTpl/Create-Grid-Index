# Create-Grid-Index
Creates a polygon feature class which acts as a grid overlain on another feature class. This is useful for setting up Data Driven Pages. The script demonstrates use of geometry objects and Describe objects in ArcPy.

This is very similar to the Grid Index Features tool in ArcMap 10. When I wrote this, I was under the impression that this tool was not available with a Basic license, but that doesn't seem to be the case now.

You can find documentation for that tool here: http://resources.arcgis.com/EN/HELP/MAIN/10.2/index.html#//00700000000q000000
